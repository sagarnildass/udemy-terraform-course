1. We will use jenkins to build docker images to be put on ecr and then run the app on ecs.

STEPS:

1. terraform apply

2. login to jenkins machine (ssh): ssh -i mykey ubuntu@13.235.104.131

3. Jenkins is throwing an error: modified the script file jenkins-init and now it works.

4. Get the pwd: cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

5. login to jenkins

6. go to manage jenkins: manage plugins: available and search for parameterized trigger pluggin

7. download it and restart jenkins.

8. create new job: docker-demo (freestyle project)

9. use git: https://github.com/wardviaene/docker-demo

10. choose execute shell in build 

11. in the jenkins instance : sudo su - jenkins and the aws-configure and put your creds there.

12. 1st line - docker build -t 960920920983.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myapp:${GIT_COMMIT} . (we obtained this from terraform output)

    2nd line -  eval "${aws ecr get-login --region ap-south-1}"

    3rd line - docker push 960920920983.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myapp:${GIT_COMMIT}

13. Save this project and create another project: docker-demo-deploy (freestyle)

14.
