1. AWS EKS is amazon elastic container service for kubernetes.

2. Kubernetes is an alternative to AWS ECS.

3. ECS is aws specific, whereas Kubernetes can run on any public cloud provider (or even on premises)

4. They are both great solutions to orchestrate containers.

5. AWS EKS provides managed kubernetes master nodes.

   - There's no master nodes to manage.
  
   - The master nodes are multi AZ to provide redundancy.
