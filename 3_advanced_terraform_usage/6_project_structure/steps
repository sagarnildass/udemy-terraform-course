1. When starting terraform on a production env, you realize that you need a decent project structure.

2. Ideally, you would want to separate production and dev env separately.

3. For complete isolation, it is best to create multiple aws accounts and use one for dev, one for prod and one for billing.

4. Splitting out terraform in multiple projects will also reduce the resources that you'll need to manage during one terraform apply.

5. You can do this in aws organizations.

6. Do first in dev, if everything is successful, apply it in prod.

7. Do terraform actions in the dev/prod dir. Do ssh-keygen separately for each of dev and prod folders.

8. If you indeed have two accounts, you need to edit provider.tf and add a profile of aws cred one for dev and one for prod.
