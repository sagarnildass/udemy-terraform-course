# Interpolation

1. In terraform you can interpolate other variables.

2. You can use simple math functions, refer to other variables, or use conditionals.

3. We have been using them throughout the course already.

# Conditionals

1. Interpolations might contain conditionals (if-else)

2. syntax: condition? trueval:falseval

e.g. count = "${var.env == "prod"?2:1}"
