1. EBS is AWS's Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution.

2. It's a platform where you launch your app without having to maintain the underlying infrastructure.

3. You are still responsible for the ec2 instances, but AWS will provide you with updates you can apply.

4. Updates can be applied manually or automatically.

5. The ec2 instances run amazon linux.

6. EBS can handle application scaling for you.

7. You can schedule scaling events or enable autoscaling based on a metric.

8. It's similar to heroku.

9. You can have an application running with just a few clicks using the aws console or using the elasticbeanstalk resource in terraform.

10. When you deploy an elastic beanstalk env, you will get a CNAME (hostname) that you can use as a endpoint.

11. You can use route 53 to point your domain to that cname.

12. Once EBS is running, you can deploy your application in it using the EB command line utility.

Steps

1. terraform apply

2. terraform output - copy the output and paste it in web browser. You will see the app running

3. git clone https://github.com/wardviaene/eb-php-example

4. Install eb cli

5. go to eb-php-example dir

6. eb init (press 1 for app)

7. eb deploy

8. Refresh your app url received previously and you will see the new app running.
