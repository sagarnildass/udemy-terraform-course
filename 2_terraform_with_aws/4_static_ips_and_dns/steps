1. Private ip addresses will be auto assigned to the ec2 instances.

2. Every subnet within a VPC has its own range (e.g. 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255)

3. By specifying the private ips, you can make sure that the ec2 instance always use the same ip address. This ip has to be in the range of the public subnet.

4. To use a public IP address, we can use EIP (Elastic Ips)

5. This is a public static ip address that we can attach to our instance.

Route 53

1. Typically we will not use IP addresses but hostnames. This is where route 53 comes in.

2. We first need to register a domain name using AWS or any other.

3. We can then create a zone in route 53 (e.g. example.com) and add DNS records (server1.example.com).

4. Adding a zone and records can also be done in terraform.

5. When registering domain name, we need to add the AWS nameservers to that domain.

6. Route 53 has a lot of name servers. To know the nameservers for your particular domain, we can use the output resource to output 
the property "aws_route53_zone.example-com.name_servers
