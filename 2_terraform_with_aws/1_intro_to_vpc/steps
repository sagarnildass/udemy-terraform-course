VPC - Virtual Private Connection

1. In aws, you have a default VPC to launch instances in.

2. Up until now, we used this default VPC.

3. VPCs isolate the instances at a network level. It's like your own private network in the cloud.

4. Best practice is to always launch instances in a VPC.

5. For smaller to medium setups, one VPC (per region) will be suitable for your needs.

6. An instance launched in one vpc can never communicate with an instance in another VPC using their private ip addresses. They could commmunicate still,

but using public ip addresses (not recommended). But we can also link two VPCs, called peering.

Private Subnets

1. Whenever we are going to set up a vpc, we are going to see that the ip addresses to be used are all private subnets.

2. These ip addresses cannot be used over internet. They are only to used privately within VPC or a home/office network.

3. There are only a few private subnets.

Range                From                  To
10.0.0.0/8           10.0.0.0              10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0/12        172.16.0.0            172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0/16       192.168.0.0           192.168.255.255            


4. Every availability zone has its own public and private subnets.

5. All the public subnets are connected to an internet gateway. These instances will also have a public ip address, allowing them to be reachable from the internet.

6. Instances launched in the private subnets dont get a public ip address, so they will not be reachable from the internet. To make them connect to the outside world, 
we use NAT gateways. But only from inside to outside but not the other way round.

7. Typically public subnets are used for internet facing apps/services.

8. And private subnets are used for databases, caching services, backends etc.

9. If you use a load balancer, you will typically put the LB in the public subnets and the instances serving an application in the private subnets.



10. Now we want to launch the instance in our newly created VPC using a keypair that will be uploaded by terraform.

11. We want a new security group for this instance. A security group is just like a firewall
