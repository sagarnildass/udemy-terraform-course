1. Now that we have autoscaled instances, we might want to put a load balancer in front of it.

2. The AWS elastic load balancer (ELB) automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances.

3. The ELB itself scales when we receive more traffic.

4. The ELB will healthcheck your instances.

5. If an instance fails its healthcheck, no traffic will be sent to it.

6. The ELB can also be used as a SSL terminator

   a) It can offload the encryption away from the ec2 instances.

   b) AWS can even manage the SSL certificates for you.

7. ELBs can be spread over multiple availability zones for higher fault tolerances.

8. ELB is comparable to a nginx/haproxy, but it is provided as a service.

9. AWS provides two types of load balancer.

   a) The classic load balancer (ELB) 

      - Routes traffic based on network information.

      - e.g. forwards all traffic from port 80 (HTTP) to port 8080 (Application)

   b) The application load balancer (ALB)

      - Routes traffic based on application information.

      - e.g. can route /api and /websites to different EC2 instances.
