1. In aws, autoscaling groups are created to automatically add/remove instances when certain thresholds are reached.

   e.g: Your app layer can be scaled out when you have more visitors.

2. To set up autoscaling in AWS, you need to set up at least 2 resources:

   a) An aws launch configuration

      -Specifies the properties of the instance to be launched (AMI id, security group etc)

   b) An autoscaling group

      -Specifies the scaling properties (min instances, max instances, health checks etc)

3. Once the autoscaling group is setup, you can create autoscaling properties.

   a) A policy is triggered based on a threshold (cloud watch alarm).

   b) An adjustment will be executed.

      - e.g. If the average CPU utilization is more than 20%, then scale up by 1+ instances.
             If the average CPU utilization is less than 5%, then scale down by 1- instances.

4. If you want to receive an alert (email) when autoscaling is invoked, need to create a SNS topic (Simple Notification Service)

5. That SNS topic needs to be attached to the autoscaling group.

Steps

1. terraform apply

2. ssh

3. sudo apt-get install stress (to generate logs)

4. stress --cpu 2 --timeout 300

5. go to ec2 and see monitoring. it will trigger alarm when it hits 30%

7. go to cloudwatch and see that an alarm has been raised.

8. go to ec2 and see that the 2nd instance has been started.

9. After 5 mins, the 2nd alarm will be triggered as the CPU utilization will go down below 5% and then 1 instance will be terminated.
