1. The t2 micro comes with 8gb EBS storage. In our next example, we will add an extra EBS storage volume

2. Extra volumes can be used for the log files, or any real data that is put on the instance.

3. We can do this by adding a resource called "aws_ebs_volume" and attach it to the instance by the resource "aws_volume_attachment".

4. After terraform apply, ssh into the instance ssh -i mykey -l ubuntu 13.127.202.138 and then sudo -s to root.

5. df -h to see the default EBS. We dont see the other one, as we have to create a file system in order to see it.

6. mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdh - to create the new file system for the new EBS.

7. Now we have to mount it. We create a new dir mkdir /data and then mount /dev/xvdh /data

8. df -h to see the new EBS

9. vim /etc/fstab and add this line

/dev/xvdh /data ext4 defaults 0 0

10. But if we destroy and relaunch this instance, this new EBS will be gone. We can counter this with userdata which we will see next.
