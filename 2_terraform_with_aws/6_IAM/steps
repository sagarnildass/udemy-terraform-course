1. IAM is AWS' Identity and Access Management

2. It's a service that helps you control access to your AWS resource.

3. In aws, with IAM, we can create

   a) Groups 

   b) Users and

   c) roles

4. Roles can give users / services temporary access that they normally wouldn't have.

5. The roles can be for instance attached to EC2 instances.

   a) From that instance, a user/service can obtain access credentials.

   b) Using those access credentials, the user or service can assume the role, which gives them permission to do something.
