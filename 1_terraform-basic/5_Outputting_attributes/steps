1. Terraform keeps the attributes of all the resources that you create.

   a) E.g - The aws_instance resource has the attribute public_ip
   
   b) Those attributes can be queried and outputted.

2. We can use "output" to display the public ip address of an aws resource

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.AMIS[var.AWS_REGION]
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${aws_instance.example.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"
  }
}

output "ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}


3. Useful for instance to start automation scripts after infrastructure provisioning.

4. You can populate the ip addresses in an ansible host file.
