1. For certain providers like aws, terraform provides data sources.

2. Data sources provide you with dynamic information.

   a) A lot of data is avaliable by aws in a structured format using their API.

   b) Terraform also exposes this info using data sources.

3. Examples - List of AMIs, list of availability zones.

4. Another great example is the datasource that gives you all ip addresses in use by AWS. This is great if you want to filter traffic based on an AWS region.

5. Filtering traffic can also be done using "security groups". Incoming and outgoing traffic can be filtered by protocol, ip range and port.

6. When we run terraform apply, we will see that a security group is created with the mentioned protocol.
