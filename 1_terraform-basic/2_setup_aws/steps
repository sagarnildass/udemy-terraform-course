A. Create IAM admin user

B. Create terraform file to spin up micro instances.

C. Run terraform apply

A)

1. Opwn AWS, search IAM and add new user called terraform with programmatic access. Add a group called terraform-administrators with admin rights and add user to this group.

2. Go to ec2. Click on security groups. Filter on "default". 

3. For this security group, edit inbound rule and add all traffic from your ip.


B)

1. We create an instance.tf file.

2. Here we specify access_key and secret_key we obtained from the last step. We get the ami id for the ec2 instance from : https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/.

3. We select ami for ap-south-1 (hvm:ebs)

C)

1. terraform init ( We will always have to run this for a new dir, if new plugins are added or if provider is changed.)

2. terraform apply.

3. To destory this instance, run: terraform destory

4. Another useful command is terraform plan. This will show you what it is planning to do without executing it.

5. Safest way is to write to a output file the plan and then apply from file: terraform plan -out out.terraform and then terraform apply "out.terraform" and then remove this out.terraform file.
